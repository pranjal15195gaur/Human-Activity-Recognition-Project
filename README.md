# Human-Activity-Recognition-Project
 This project focuses on human activity recognition using the UCI-HAR dataset, which comprises time-series data from subjects performing six distinct activities. The TSFEL library was employed to extract comprehensive features from the raw time-series data. To enhance the efficiency of the model, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied for dimensionality reduction. A Decision Tree model was then trained on these features to classify the activities. For validation and testing, new activity data was collected using the Physics Toolbox Suite app, demonstrating the model's practical application and accuracy in real-world scenarios.
